### Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC)

**What is Flash of Unstyled Content? How do you avoid FOUC?**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div style="background-color: rgba(100, 108, 255, 0.16); padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #fff; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 500;">
<p>Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) occurs when a web page appears briefly with the default browser styling before the custom CSS is loaded, leading to a noticeable shift in the page's appearance. To avoid FOUC:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Place CSS in the `<head>`</strong>: Ensure all CSS links are in the `<head>` section of your HTML so they load before the body renders.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize CSS</strong>: Reduce the size of CSS files to speed up loading times.</li>
<li><strong>Use Critical CSS</strong>: Include style rules for above-the-fold content directly in the `<head>` to render important parts of the page immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid @import</strong>: Inline @import calls can delay loading of CSS, so it’s better to link stylesheets directly.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>


### ARIA and Screenreaders

**Explain what ARIA and screenreaders are, and how to make a website accessible.**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div style="background-color: rgba(100, 108, 255, 0.16); padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #fff; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 500;">
<p>ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) and screenreaders are tools and techniques used to enhance website accessibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ARIA</strong>: A set of attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. ARIA helps with dynamic content and complex user interface controls developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Screenreaders</strong>: Software programs that help visually impaired users interact with a website by reading text and UI elements aloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make a website accessible:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semantic HTML</strong>: Use proper HTML elements for their intended purpose to ensure correct element interpretation by screen readers.</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard Navigation</strong>: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible using the keyboard alone.</li>
<li><strong>Color Contrast</strong>: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors to help those with visual impairments.</li>
<li><strong>Alt Text</strong>: Use descriptive alt text for all images to convey the purpose and content of the images.</li>
<li><strong>ARIA Roles and Properties</strong>: Use ARIA roles and attributes to enhance the semantic information of web elements, especially for dynamic content and advanced user interface controls that are not natively accessible.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>

### CSS vs. JavaScript Animations

<p>CSS and JavaScript animations each have their advantages and disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CSS Animations:</strong>
  <ul>
  <li>Pros: Simpler to implement, generally perform better as they can be offloaded to the GPU, and are ideal for simpler "state-to-state" transitions.</li>
  <li>Cons: Limited control compared to JavaScript, particularly with complex sequences or where interactivity is involved.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript Animations:</strong>
  <ul>
  <li>Pros: Provide more control, can handle complex animations and are programmable (timing, pausing, reversing).</li>
  <li>Cons: Potentially slower, especially if not well optimized or if causing main thread blocking.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>

### CORS

**What does CORS stand for and what issue does it address?**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div style="background-color: rgba(100, 108, 255, 0.16); padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #fff; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 500;">
<p>CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a security feature implemented in web browsers to prevent malicious websites from accessing data from another domain. CORS provides a way for web servers to specify any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. CORS issues arise when trying to make requests to a domain different from the one serving the web page, which is restricted by the same-origin policy — a critical security mechanism that restricts how documents or scripts from one origin can interact with resources from another.</p>
</div>

<p>In cases of disagreement, I strive to approach the situation professionally by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Listening Actively</strong>: Understanding the other person's perspective fully before responding.</li>
<li><strong>Providing Evidence</strong>: Backing up my points with data, examples, or references to best practices.</li>
<li><strong>Seeking Compromise</strong>: Looking for solutions that might satisfy both parties' goals

.</li>
<li><strong>Escalating Appropriately</strong>: If no resolution can be found, seeking advice or mediation from another colleague or supervisor.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach helps to resolve conflicts constructively, ensuring professional relationships remain positive and productive.</p>
